SCANSSH V2.0
-------------

ScanSSH scans the given addresses and networks for running services.
It mainly detects open proxies and Internet services.  For known
services, ScanSSH will query their version number and displays the
results in a list.

This program was originally written under OpenBSD as a personal
measurement tool.  However, besides gathering statistics, it's also
useful for other purposes such as ensuring that all machines on your
network run the latest SSH versions, etc...

It is BSD-licensed, please see the source files.

The program requires

	libpcap - http://www.tcpdump.org/
	libevent - http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
	libdnet - http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/

Built and tested on NetBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, but it should also run with
other UNIX-like operating systems.

To build,

	./configure
	make
	make install

should make you happy.
